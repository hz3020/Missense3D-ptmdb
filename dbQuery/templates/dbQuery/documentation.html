                <p>Post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins refers to the process of chemically altering a protein after it has been synthesized. 
                  Often times these chemical alterations include covalent additions of lipids and carbohydrates to amino acid side chains, which consequently can diversify protein function and increase proteomic complexity. 
                Genetic variation refers to the difference in DNA among individuals, which are often caused by mutations and genetic recombination. 
                With the advancements of modern sequencing technology, over 324 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms<sup><a href="https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2017/05/08/dbsnps-human-build-150-has-doubled-the-amount-of-refsnp-records/" target="_blank" title="Click here to go to source." data-toggle="tooltip">[1]</a></sup> have been identified, but determining whether these 
                genetic variants have functional impact on phenotypes remains a challenge. Missense3D-PTM is a database that maps 139,695 PTMs and 8,739,608 missense variants across the set of 20,277 canonical proteins within the human proteome. 
                Missense3D-PTM acts as a resource to identify PTM-specific missense mutations, which can allow researchers around the world to better understand the regulatory mechanisms impacted by their genetic variant of interest.</p>

                  Within the Results page, besides the userâ€™s queried position, other potentially relevant information pertaining to the queried protein is displayed. In particular, all of the positions with a known PTM and variant at the same site are displayed alongside the corresponding wild type residue, mutant residue, variant SNP IDs associated with the mutant, and PTM type. This information is particularly useful as it can provide valuable insights into the functional consequences, disease mechanisms, regulatory mechanisms, etc. for a particular PTM and/or variant. Similar to the other results, the PTM & Variant Co-site results are displayed in an interactive table with tooltip features and a dynamic expand/collapse button to enhance the UI/UX. In addition to these features, the ability to (1) filter the table by the PTM type and (2) select positions from the table to be displayed on the proteinâ€™s 3D structure have also been incorporated into the interactive design of the table.

                <span>
                  The JSmol section on the Results page is designed to demonstrate the structure and topology of the queried protein. The figure below illustrates the comprehensive layout of the JSmol section within the Results interface. 
                  Starting with the JSmol applet at the top, users are provided with the AlphaFold-generated model of the protein. This setup allows for an in-depth exploration of regional details through rotation and zooming into the 3D
                  model. Distinct sections of the protein are distinguished by different colour coding â€” <span style=" border-bottom: 1px solid lightblue;">light blue</span>
                  for extracellular regions, <span style=" border-bottom: 1px solid violet;">violet</span> for intracellular regions, <span style=" border-bottom: 1px solid aqua;">aqua</span> for transmembrane regions, and <span style=" border-bottom: 1px solid grey;">grey</span> for other unspecified areas â€” facilitating a visual understanding of the proteinâ€™s topological features.
                </span>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                  <img src="{% static 'dbQuery/images/jsmolFullWindow.png' %}" alt="Image Description" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto;">
                </p>
                Beneath the JSmol applet lies the control panel, where users can execute additional commands. While the target residue is automatically coloured in orange, users may find it challenging to locate, especially within large and complex proteins. 
                To address this, a button is inserted to center the view on the target position and highlight the specific residue by its atomic surface (as seen in Panel C). Furthermore, users have the option to switch between different display modes for the model by activating or deactivating the Space-filling feature as seen in Panel B & D.
                By default, the JSmol applet shows the protein in animated mode where residues are linearised to focus on the proteinâ€™s secondary structure. In contrast, the Space-fill button shows the atomic backbone of the protein, providing more detailed structural information at the residue level. Notice that the query residue can be highlighted regardless of the space- filling status, which offers additional flexibility to visualise the residue of interest.
                Lastly, a reset button is available to reload the JSmol applet with its default settings. This ensures that users can start the presentation afresh without having to manually undo previous adjustments.
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                  <img src="{% static 'dbQuery/images/jsmol_butttonFeatures.png' %}" alt="JSmol button features" style="max-width: 40%; height: auto;">
                </p>
                The sequence viewer is designed to complement the use of the AlphaFold model thus it is interactively connected to the JSmol applet. This integration allows users to select and mark positions of interest on the sequence viewer, while the corresponding residues are simultaneously highlighted in the AlphaFold model. The marking and highlighting can be either temporary or permanent, depending on the userâ€™s actions: hovering over the sequence adds temporary marking and highlighting following the cursor movement, clicking on the sequence, however, locks the effects on the interface and the JSmol applet until the same residue is clicked again as seen below. Multiple residues can be highlighted simultaneously.
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                  <img src="{% static 'dbQuery/images/jsmolSelectSeq.png' %}" alt="JSmol select seq" style="max-width: 40%; height: auto;">
                </p>
                The lower half of the JSmol area features a sequence viewer, enabling users to compare the residuesâ€™ sequential positions with their structural positions as depicted in the JSmol applet. By default, this interface is collapsed to prevent an long protein sequence from overly extending the Results page. However, users have the option to expand this section to view the complete protein sequence. 
                The sequence is colour-coded according to the proteinâ€™s topology, mirroring the same colouring scheme applied previously in the AlphaFold model. 
                Additional protein information can be accessed via two buttons located at the bottom of the sequence interface.
               These buttons reveal the locations of additional variants and PTM sites on the protein as seen below. 
               Because they are designed independently with unique displaying effects, users can activate them jointly to locate residues of combined interests.
               <p style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="{% static 'dbQuery/images/highlightPTMandVar.png' %}" alt="Highlight PTM and Var" style="max-width: 60%; height: auto;">
              </p>
              A distance slider is positioned between the JSmol buttons and the sequence viewer to control the display of neighbouring residues around the target position. This slider displays residues within specified distance ranges from the target position in 3D space, measured in Angstroms. The distance is calculated as the straight line connecting the Î±-carbon atoms of the target residue and other nearby residues. The slider offers six levels, corresponding to distances ranging from a minimum of 5 ÌŠA to a maximum of 30 ÌŠA. The figure below illustrates the effects of different slider levels, in this case, comparing 5 ÌŠA to 25 ÌŠA, on the protein model displayed in JSmol.
              Adjusting the slider level also directly impacts the sequence interface: residues within the current distance range limit are dynamically marked in the sequence viewer. This helps users identify specific residues of interest adjacent to the target residue. Furthermore, like all other JSmol functionalities developed in this project, the distance sliderâ€™s effects do not conflict with other existing effects, allowing users to customize their experience by combining various functionalities. For instance, users can first highlight specific residues of interest and then use the distance slider to determine their distance from the target position.
